However, Expo also accepts platform-specific keys under ios.icon and android.icon. If either of these exist, they will take priority over the base icon key on their respective platform. Further customization of the Android icon is possible using the android.adaptiveIcon key, which will override both of the previously mentioned settings. Most production-quality apps will probably want to provide something slightly different between iOS and Android.",
